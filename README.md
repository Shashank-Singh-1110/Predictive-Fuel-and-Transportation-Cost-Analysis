For businesses in logistics, shipping, or supply chain management, daily transportation costs are a major and volatile expense. This volatility, driven by fluctuating fuel prices, weather, and operational factors, makes accurate budgeting and financial planning extremely difficult.

This project aims to solve this problem by building a machine learning model to predict daily transportation costs. The final tool will analyze real-world data to forecast expenses, helping a business make smarter financial decisions, optimize its fleet, and plan logistics more effectively.
